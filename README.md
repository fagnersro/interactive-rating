## Overview

Your challenge is to build this interactive sorting component and make it look as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tool you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a try.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScripit

### What I learned

Very interesting project to do because it helped me a lot to fix some concepts that I'm studying about functions in JavaScrip, also subjects like selecting, listening and getting the value of an element in the html document and showing the obtained value added to the learning list.

### Continued development

Despite being able to display every designer on screen, I feel that I need to be clearer in my CSS, and in fact this does not discourage me, it only reinforces the need for a continuous learning process in which I remain firm, familiarizing myself with the semantics of HTMl and always putting it into practice JavaScript studies.
